                <p>Xiao Long Bao - My favorite desert. 
                   Different from other kinds of so-called dumplings in English, Xiao Long Bao has a thinner buns made up with unleavened dough with soup,pieces of bamboo shoots, pork/shrimp inside.</p>
                <p>Dongpo pork - as one of the most well-know dish in Hangzhou. 
                   Though people here don't prepare it as a daily dish. It is so popular that everyone who visits Hangzhou would like to have a try. 
                   It is made by pan-frying and then red cooking pork belly. 
                   It is named in Dongpo, because it is said that Su Dongpo, one of the most famous poet in ancient China firstly prepare pork in this way.</p>
                <p>Crabs in Orange - Although it is a traditional dish with a long history, I knew it just few weeks ago through a TV show. 
                   Autumn is the season for tasting crabs. 
                   Seprate the crab into different parts and put them into an orange with other traditional ingredients and flavours, then steam them. 
                   it is really a fortune to enjoy it!</p>
